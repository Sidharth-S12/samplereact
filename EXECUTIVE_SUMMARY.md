## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
| Decision | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Vite** | 3-5x faster, modern | Create React App |
| **Context API** | Simpler, built-in | Redux (overkill) |
| **Tailwind** | Utility-first, fast | Bootstrap |
| **Firebase** | Realtime, serverless | Traditional backend |
| **React Router v6** | Modern, hooks-ready | Older versions |

### Architecture Pattern
- Feature-based folder structure
- Service layer for business logic
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Context for global state
- Component composition over inheritance
